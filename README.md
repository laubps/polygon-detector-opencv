# Polygon Detector Desktop App with OpenCV

## Overview
This advanced C++ project utilizes OpenCV to detect and classify polygons in digital images. The main goal is to accurately identify edges and contours, classify polygon types such as triangles and quadrilaterals, and provide a user-friendly graphical interface for ease of use.

## Features
- **Edge and Polygon Detection**: Detects edges and contours in images with high precision.
- **Polygon Classification**: Identifies and classifies polygons such as triangles, quadrilaterals, and more. Enhanced with basic AI algorithms for improved accuracy.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Developed with Qt to offer an intuitive and interactive experience. Easily load images, view results, and adjust settings.
- **Advanced Image Processing**: Utilizes OpenCV for detailed image analysis and processing.
- **Customizable and Scalable**: Designed to be easily extendable for future updates and features.

## Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Images in formats like JPEG, PNG, and BMP.
- **Outputs**: Displays identified polygons on-screen with labels.
